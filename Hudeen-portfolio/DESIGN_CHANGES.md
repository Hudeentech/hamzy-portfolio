# Graphic Design Portfolio Redesign

I have completely overhauled the aesthetics of your portfolio to align with a modern, premium "Graphic Design" style.

## Key Changes

### 1. Design System (`index.css`)
- **Theme**: Deep "Onyx Black" (`#050505`) with "Electric Amber" (`#ffb703`) accents.
- **Typography**: Swapped generic fonts for a bold pairing:
    - **Headings**: `Outfit` (Bold, Modern, Geomentric).
    - **Body**: `Space Grotesk` (Technical, Clean).
- **UI Elements**: Added glassmorphism (blur effects) to navigation and cards.

### 2. Component Updates

#### Navigation
- Converted from a solid pill to a **floating glass bar**.
- Added subtle hover glow effects to links.
- Improved mobile responsive sidebar.

#### Hero Section
- **Big & Bold**: Increased headline size massive (Graphic Design style).
- **Grid Layout**: clean split between text and visuals.
- **Background**: Added a subtle radial gradient interaction.

#### Projects
- **Grid System**: Implemented a responsive masonry-style grid for project cards.
- **Interactions**: Cards lift and glow on hover.
- **Modal**: Refined the project detail modal with better typography.

#### About & Services
- Applied the new grid system and bold typography to these sections.
- Added clean, minimalist borders and hover effects.

#### Footer
- Removed the background image for a cleaner, editorial look.
- Centered typography for a strong finish.
